## **About the Project**

> Developed this project to demonstrate my expertise in developing Full stack enterprise application.
> This repository supports the source code for Spring Boot backend application to demo the Catalog Management Software.

Catalog management software enables businesses to efficiently create, organize, and update their product catalogs by storing and managing all product-related information like product descriptions, pricing, images, and metadata in a centralized location, allowing for accurate and consistent product details across various platforms; essentially acting as a central repository for a company's product catalog. Allow businesses publish their catalogs on various channels.

Java 23, Spring Framework 6.2.1, Spring Boot 3.4.1, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate and PostgreSQL 17.2

This backend repository can be interacted with either Angular or React JS frontend applications which are available here in this profile.

## **Features**
1. Creating products with product digital assets, reviews, inventory and pricing
2. Import the product information from csv files
3. Export the existing product information to csv files

Note: Following are the features which will be implemnetd in future version.
1. Ability to create different channels
2. Publish the product catalogs across various channels with different requirements
3. Auto classification of products based on configured criteria
4. Docker containerization for Spring Boot and PostgreSQL

### **Key Highlights**
- Developed modular backend services with REST APIs for scalability and performance.
- Built dynamic, user-friendly frontends to handle catalog interactions using Angular and React.
- Leveraged relational (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases for flexibility in data storage.
- Demonstrated full-stack expertise by designing, implementing, and deploying two parallel technology stacks.
